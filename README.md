## Description
This project contains my setup files for the Space Mission Control theme, including learning goals, Git basics explanations, knowledge log, and a system test script.

## Instructions
To run the system test:
```bash
node system_test.js
````

## GitHub Repository Link
https://github.com/magesh149/SpaceMission_Submission.git






Great ðŸš€ Here are the **exact Git + terminal commands** you need to push your `SpaceMission_Submission/` folder to GitHub:

---

### **Step 1: Initialize Git**

```bash
cd SpaceMission_Submission
git init
```

---

### **Step 2: Add Remote Repository**

(Replace `<your-repo-link>` with your actual GitHub repo URL)

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-link>
```

---

### **Step 3: Stage and Commit Files**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Space Mission Control Setup"
```

---

### **Step 4: Push to GitHub**

If your repo is new and empty:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

âœ… After this, your repository link should be public and can be added to your `README.md`.

---

âš¡ Do you also want me to prepare the **exact ZIP file creation commands** for Linux/Mac and Windows so you can easily package `YourName_SpaceMission.zip`?
