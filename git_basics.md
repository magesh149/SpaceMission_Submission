## Git Basics

### git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores all version control information for the project.  

### git add
This command stages changes (new, modified, or deleted files) so that they can be included in the next commit. It doesn’t save the changes permanently but prepares them for committing.  

### git commit
This command takes a snapshot of the staged changes and saves it in the repository’s history. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.  

### git push
This command uploads your local commits to a remote repository, such as GitHub. It ensures your work is shared and backed up on the remote server.
